# Java_OOP_Practicals

This repository includes my java OOP practical labsheet programs under uni reg no. FC110531

Check branches for separate labsheet files and the main for all the labsheet programs

You can run the files by going into the src directory until the .java file and running the java file in the terminal. (opening a terminal in the directory and type : java javaprogram.java)

This repo is solely used as a labsheet code storage other than a version-controlled project
